Description
===========================================================
Our program is a representation of a 3D Tron (the movie) 
environment. We have a grid, and if you go under the grid,
look up and see what happens!

Our program uses ambient lighting, as well as specular 
lighting. We draw objects with a solid color, using VBO's.
Each object has a spotlight just above it's max Y value to 
give the object a nicer look.

We animate our objects using the glutTimerFunc(). We have
5 space ships, 1 Tron cycle, 1 ship fleet, 1 satellite,
1 smaller space ship. Explore our world and see what you find.
